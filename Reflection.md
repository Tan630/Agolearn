## Originality

I try to replace paragraphs in every template with own words. In doing so, I can confirm my interpretation with the instructor and ensure that I truly understand the motivation that drives each template.

For example, to replace

>  Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing soft ware. A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming team. We advocate a decomposition based on the principle of information hiding. This principle supports design for change, because the “secrets” that each module hides represent likely future changes. Design for change is valuable in SC, where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the solution space is explored.

I wrote

> A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming team. Decomposing a system into modules promotes abstraction information hiding and supports design for change.
>
> A module presents an abstract interface that hides secrets. Secrets are system details that are likely to change; hiding secrets, therefore, allows such changes to take place without affecting the interface.
>
> Design for change is valuable in scientific computing, where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the solution space is explored.

By checking my interpretation with the instructor, I confirmed that (a) modularisation promotes information hiding and design for change; (b) Parnas advocates modularisation primarily by work (as opposed, for example, responsibility); (c) likely and unlikely changes motivate secrets and interfaces, respectively.

## Context

I comprehensive [README](https://github.com/Tan630/Agolearn/blob/main/README.md) and [CONTRIBUTE](https://github.com/Tan630/Agolearn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) files. The latter, in particular, outlines stylistics and procedural standards.

## Review Comments

All my reviews are constructive and most offer actionable advice. For example, [one of my recent issues](https://github.com/AtiyehSayadi/Centrality-In-Graphs/issues/57) offers two ways to prototype an interface while also giving a concrete example. I probably should not spend so much time on this.

I never close issues without a comment. In cases where I partially address the proposed problem, I make sure to explain my rationale. As a long example, a [SRS review](https://github.com/Tan630/Agolearn/issues/30) leads to the creation of a [child issue](https://github.com/Tan630/Agolearn/issues/39) to address it. Then, [two](https://github.com/Tan630/Agolearn/commit/fa66d9e02e56345425a5f9eed484826d6df3ecb2) [commits](https://github.com/Tan630/Agolearn/issues/34) fix the child issue. Resolution of the child issue allows me to close the original, parent issue as well. This process is outlined in [CONTRIBUTE.md](https://github.com/Tan630/Agolearn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
